## File Structure

Each category is stored in a separate JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "category": "Category Name",
  "description": "Brief description of the category",
  "words": [
    "word1",
    "word2",
    "word3"
  ]
}
```

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by [mute.life](https://mute.life/), a crowd-sourced list of words to mute on social media created by [levels.io](https://twitter.com/levelsio). We aim to expand on this concept by providing categorized lists in JSON format for easier integration and customization.
